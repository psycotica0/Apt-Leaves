apt-leaves

This program is used to find all packages installed on your debian system that aren't depended upon by other packages.

I wrote it to help me clean packages I installed once then forgot about off my computer by putting them into a list for me.

Also, with apt-get autoremove it also is the case that often I'll go through a session of uninstalling programs with this list, then
it'll suddenly be like "Oh, well if you're uninstalling those, then all of these are useless now too"
That makes me happy.

So, you just run it.
Then it outputs to stdout the list of packages.
